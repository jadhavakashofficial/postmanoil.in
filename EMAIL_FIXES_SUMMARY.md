# Email System Fixes - Postman Oils Contact Forms

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### **1. Contact Form Not Sending Emails**
**Problem:** The main contact form (`/contact-us`) was using a mock timeout instead of actually sending emails.

**Solution:** Updated the form submission to properly call the PHP email handler:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://postmanoil.com/blog/postman-contact-handler.php', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    ...formData,
    formType: 'contact-us-page'
  }),
});
```

### **2. Email Recipient Updated**
**Problem:** Emails were being sent to `marketingpostmanoil@gmail.com`

**Solution:** Updated email recipient to `jadhavakashofficial@gmail.com` in:
- PHP email handler
- Email footer templates
- All confirmation emails

### **3. Email Reliability Improvements**
**Problem:** Emails had low success rate (1 out of 4)

**Solutions Applied:**
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Improved email header formatting for WordPress compatibility
- Enhanced fallback mechanisms between wp_mail and PHP mail()
- Added debug information in API responses
- Better error handling and user feedback

## 📧 Email Flow

### **When a user submits any contact form:**

1. **Company Notification Email** → `jadhavakashofficial@gmail.com`
   - Contains form data (name, email, phone, subject, message)
   - Professional template with Postman logo
   - Clear action button to reply directly

2. **User Confirmation Email** → User's email address
   - Thank you message with Postman branding
   - Copy of their submitted information
   - Company contact details
   - Professional template design
